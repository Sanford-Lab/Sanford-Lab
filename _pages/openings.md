# Open Positions
We are currently looking for postdoctoral fellows to join the SPIRES lab in Fall 2025! We are also accepting up to 3 research masters students in the [MESc](https://environment.yale.edu/academics/masters/mfs-mesc) program.

## PhD Position

**There are not currently open PhD positions in the lab in the School of Environment. Interested students can apply to the Political Science PhD program at Yale**

My doctoral students work on how political and economic institutions influence when natural resources are conserved or exploited. My doctoral students all have a strong statistics, modeling, machine learning, or remote sensing background and are interested in environmental political economy questions. Most take 2 years of coursework and at least one field exam in the Political Science, Statistics and Data Science, or Economics departments. More information and the application can be found [here](https://environment.yale.edu/admissions/doctoral)

## Postdoctoral Positions
We are seeking applicants for two postdoctoral research fellow positions focused on environmental political economy and environmental data science at the Yale School of the Environment. We seek to leverage new, high dimensional sources of data including satellite imagery and text to answer questions at the frontier of human well-being, climate change, environmental policy, and economic development. We develop and implement machine learning methods paired with statistical causal inference to answer challenging policy questions, often in non-experimental settings. Our group includes students from the School of Environment and Forest School, the Political Science Department, the Statistics and Data Science department, the Math department, and the Engineering department.

We are seeking a diverse pool of applicants who wish to join a collaborative and constructive community that values interdisciplinary, problem-driven research. Postdoctoral fellows take on leadership roles in the group with the possibility to mentor other lab members at the PhD, Masters, and Undergraduate levels.

Postdoctoral positions are for one year with the option to renew for a second year contingent on performance and funding. Postdoctoral salaries are determined by the Yale Office for Postdoctoral Affairs, but are $56,448 at a minimum in the first year, and increase with experience. Postdoctoral associates will have funded research assistants and a research budget and are expected to spend a minimum of 50% of their time on collaborative, lab projects (led or co-led by the postdoc).

<!-- # Open positions

**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [veni fellowship](https://www.nwo.nl/en/calls/nwo-talent-programme-veni-science-domain) or the Marie Curie fellowship (currently closed, next deadline probably Fall 2021, [here is last years call]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/h2020-wp1820-msca_en.pdf)).**




We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries.

### Master projects for Leiden University students
If you are a Master student at Leiden University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
